# Getting started
### How to submit a contribution:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request.

# How to report a bug
### Security disclosures:
If you find a security vulnerability, do **NOT** open an issue. Contact @djkcool on Discord instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security vulnerability, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If you answer "yes" to either of these two questions, then it is probably a security vulnerability, and even if you answer "no" to both questions, it could still be a security vulnerability, so if you're unsure, just let us know.

### How to file an issue:

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Ping-Tester are you using?
2. What Windows version are you on?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### Suggesting a feature:
1. Open an issue on the Ping-Tester Github page with the feature tag.
2. Describe the feature you would like to see in Ping-Tester.
3. Explain why you need it and how this feature would work.

# Code review process
### How a contribution gets accepted:
The core team will look at Pull Requests on a semi-regular basis and decide whether or not the Pull Request should be accepted based on:

* What does it add/fix?
* Is that addition/fix necessary?
* Does the Pull Request comply with our code of conduct and basic expectations?
* Is there a better way of doing what has been done in the Pull Request?

If a Pull Request is accepted it will be merged into the project codebase shortly after acceptance.

# Code and issue labeling conventions

### Preferred code style:
* Comment to explain complex tasks.
* Break up different sections of code.
* Use camelCase.
* Use descriptive variable and label names.
* Use ```REM``` for comments **NOT** ```::```.

### Labeling conventions for issues:
* **Issue Types:**
    * **Bug** - Anything that is broken.
    * **Feature** - A new feature to be added to the project.
    * **Cleanup** - Just cleaning up the code (No bugs or features).
    * **Documentation** - Adding/Changing things related to documentation.
